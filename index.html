<h2>Work</h2>
<p>For a few years now, I've been working in the Monroe Parks and Recreation department. I love my job because it involves working with kids. I work in three different programs to be with kids of all ages</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tot Lot (3-5 year olds)</li>
  <li>Adventure Club (7-11 year olds)</li>
  <li>Rec Fun (Any age with a mental disability)</li>
</ul>
